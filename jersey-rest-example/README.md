# Jersey REST example

## How to run

To run this you need to install Tomcat server on your machine (or Jetty if you prefer).

Assuming you have IntelliJ as your IDE create a configuration for a Tomcat Server (Local)
and select the rest-jersey-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war artifact in the deployment tab and
change the application context to `/`.

Run the configuration.
